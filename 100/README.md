# 100 - Introduction

With StepZen you can build a GraphQL API for any data source in minutes, and deploy it to the cloud in seconds.  Get up and running right away 👉🏼 https://www.stepzen.com/getting-started

In this video, @gethackteam  will teach you how to query Airtable with GraphQL in two different ways. Either by using StepZen GraphQL Studio, or by converting a REST API call to GraphQL using "stepzen import curl". 

Find Airtable in StepZen GraphQL Studio here: https://graphql.stepzen.com/airtable

**NOTE**: As currently Airtable has deprecated the use of API keys, but the plugin for Airtable in Stepzen still requires an Airtable API Key, we have moved to using Baserow instead of Airtable (besides, Baserow is Open Source, whereas Airtable is not).
